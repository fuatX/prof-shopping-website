# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is designed to create a functional card component using data fetched from a local database.
It utilizes React, TypeScript, and Vite for an efficient and streamlined development experience.



## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a dynamic card component that retrieves and displays information from a local database.
The setup leverages React for UI development, TypeScript for type safety, and Vite for fast builds and Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

## Features

React with TypeScript: Provides robust type-checking and modern JavaScript features.
Vite Integration: Ensures fast build times and efficient development with HMR.
Local Database Interaction: Demonstrates how to fetch and display data from a local source.
ESLint Configuration: Maintains code quality and consistency.

## Setting Up the Project
Initialize the project with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
Install necessary dependencies and plugins:
@vitejs/plugin-react for Fast Refresh using Babel.
eslint-plugin-react for linting React code.
Configure ESLint for enhanced type checking and coding standards.
This setup provides a solid foundation for developing a React application that efficiently handles data from a local database while ensuring code quality and performance.
